We invite researchers and engineers interested in incorporating sustainability concepts into geotechnical engineering theory and practice. Interdisciplinary research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries and brings new insights into geotechnical engineering fields are welcome.

The conference key themes are as follows:

* energy geostructures
* sustainable geotechnical design and construction
* smart geotechnical monitoring
* geo-hazard mitigation
* sustainable geo-materials
* geo-environmental engineering
* T.B.C.
