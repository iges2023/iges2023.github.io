We invite researchers and engineers interested in incorporating sustainability concepts into geotechnical engineering theory and practice. Interdisciplinary research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries and brings new insights into geotechnical engineering fields are welcome.

The conference key themes are as follows:

* Properties of geomaterials & sustainable construction materials
* Constitutive modeling
* Advanced numerical approaches
* Smart geotechnical monitoring
* Big data and artificial intelligence in geotechnics
* Geo-energy engineering
* Geo-environmental engineering
* Geo-hazard assessment and mitigation
* Sustainability and resilience of infrastructures
