* energy geostructures
* sustainable geotechnical design and construction
* smart geotechnical monitoring
* geo-hazard mitigation
* sustainable geo-materials
* geo-environmental engineering

# Key dates

* Submission deadline: **TBC**
* Acceptance notification: **TBC**
* Conference date: **Dec 1-2 , 2023**

# Submission details

We invite researchers to submit their recent work on the development, analysis, or application of score-based methods.
